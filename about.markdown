Personal website for Clayton Kosonocky. I am currently doing my PhD at UT Austin. Research broadly uses AI for small molecule drug discovery and protein design. 

Hopefully will be updated soon to contain my background (publications, projects, organization history), blogs/essays, books that I like, etc.
